## This Script opens Keynote and adjusts Presenter Notes for readability by LJRich from a script by DerickFay
## This will strip out any previous formatting and make your notes uniform 
## make sure the document you want to alter is the active one i.e. the window is on top
## OK let's go

tell application "Keynote"
	
	tell document 1
		set theSlides to slides
		repeat with s in the slides
			tell presenter notes of s
				set font to "Helvetica"
				
				## choose your font size below (good values 16 to 24)
				set size to 20
				
				## choose the colour of your font here. Note in dark mode "black" should appear white
				set color of it to "black"
				
				## I improve readability by a small gap under each line (good value 1.0 to 2.0)
				set spacing to 1.2
			end tell
		end repeat
	end tell
end tell
